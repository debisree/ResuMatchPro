# Resume Scoring System - How It Works

## Overall Score: 0-120 Points

Your resume is scored across **4 main categories**, each worth **30 points max**:

### 1. COMPLETENESS (0-30 points)
**How we calculate:**
- Email present: +4 points
- Phone present: +3 points  
- LinkedIn/GitHub/Portfolio: +2 points
- Summary section exists: +5 points
- Experience section exists: +6 points
- Education section exists: +6 points
- Skills section exists: +3 points
- Appropriate length (200-800 words): +1 point

**Example:** If you have email (4) + phone (3) + LinkedIn (2) + all sections (5+6+6+3) + good length (1) = **30/30**

### 2. SUMMARY QUALITY (0-30 points)
**How we calculate:**
- Coverage of roles/domains/tools: up to 8 points
- Word count (50-150 words): up to 4 points
- Specificity (tools, domains, roles mentioned): up to 6 points
- Impact verbs density: up to 6 points
- Evidence/metrics in summary: up to 4 points
- Faithfulness check (no false claims): up to 2 points penalty

**Example scoring:**
- No summary: **0/30**
- Weak summary (50 words, 1 verb, no metrics): **~10/30**
- Good summary (80 words, 3 verbs, 1 metric, specific tools): **~22/30**
- Excellent summary (100 words, 5+ verbs, 2+ metrics, specific): **28-30/30**

### 3. EDUCATION (0-30 points)
**How we calculate:**
- Has education section: +8 points (base)
- Degree keywords (BS, MS, PhD, etc.): up to 10 points
- Graduation year(s) present: up to 7 points
- Thesis/capstone/dissertation: +2 points
- GPA 3.5+: +3 points (or GPA 3.0+: +1 point)
- Academic honors (Dean's List, Cum Laude): +3 points

**Example: Why 27/30 instead of 30/30?**
If you have: Education section (8) + Degree (10) + Year (7) + No thesis (0) + No GPA/honors (0) = **25/30**
If you have: Education section (8) + Degree (10) + Year (7) + Thesis (2) + No GPA/honors (0) = **27/30**
**To get 30/30:** Add GPA 3.5+ or academic honors (+3 points)

### 4. EMPLOYMENT (0-30 points)
**How we calculate:**
- Has experience section: +8 points (base)
- Bullet points (2 bullets = 1 point): up to 6 points max
- Quantifiable metrics (%, $, numbers): up to 8 points (1 metric = 1 point)
- Years of experience: up to 8 points
  - <1 year: +2 points
  - 1-3 years: +4 points
  - 3-8 years: +6 points
  - 8+ years: +8 points

**Example: Why 22/30?**
Experience section (8) + 6 bullets (3) + 3 metrics (3) + 5 years exp (6) + Missing dates (0) = **20/30**
**To improve:** Add 2-3 more quantifiable achievements (+2-3 points)
